```{r}
age <- c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16,17)
wing_length <- c(1.4,1.5,2.2,2.4,3.1,3.2,3.2,3.9,4.1,4.7,4.5,5.2,5.0)
age_winglength <- data.frame(age, wing_length)
plot(age_winglength)
```
Add the Linear Regression Line
```{r}
plot(age_winglength)
model <- lm(wing_length ~ age, data = age_winglength)
  abline(model, col = "red")

```
Can the null hypothesis be rejected?
```{r}
summary(model)
```
```{r}
if (summary(model)$coefficients["age", "Pr(>|t|)"] < 0.05) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant relationship between x and y.")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant relationship between x and y.")
}
```
Plotting Confidence Intervals 
```{r}
# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
set.seed(123)
x <- age
y <- wing_length

# Create a data frame
data <- age_winglength

# Perform linear regression
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)

# Create the plot with confidence intervals
plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +  # Scatterplot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +  # Linear regression line with CIs
  labs(title = "Scatterplot with Regression Line and Confidence Intervals of Age vs Winglength",
       x = "X-axis", y = "Y-axis")

# Print the plot
print(plot)

# Get the summary of the linear regression model
summary(model)
```

Extracting R-squared
```{r}
# Get the summary of the model
model_summary <- summary(model)

# Extract the R-squared value from the summary
r_squared <- model_summary$r.squared

# Print the R-squared value
cat("R-squared:", r_squared)
```
Calculate Pearson's R
```{r}
# Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient
correlation_coefficient <- cor(age, wing_length)

# Print the correlation coefficient
cat("Pearson's correlation coefficient (r):", correlation_coefficient)
```
```{r}
# Generate or load your original data
x <- age
y <- wing_length # Original data with noise

# Add noise to the dependent variable while keeping the same length
noise <- rnorm(13, mean = 0, sd = 20)  # Adding more noise
y_noisy <- y + noise

# Fit a linear regression model to the noisy data
model_noisy <- lm(y_noisy ~ x)

# Create a scatter plot of the original data
plot(x, y, main = "Original Data with Linear Regression Line")

# Overlay the regression line for the original data
abline(lm(y ~ x), col = "blue")

# Create a scatter plot of the noisy data
plot(x, y_noisy, main = "Noisy Data with Linear Regression Line")

# Overlay the regression line for the noisy data
abline(model_noisy, col = "red")
```
